Build a ResNet Neural Network to classify images with or without stop signs.

Resnet Neural Networks pass node outputs as an input to the following layer, and the layer after that. This allows greater weight to be placed on early nodes and thus reducing the effect of vanishing gradient - reducing the training time for deep neural networks.
