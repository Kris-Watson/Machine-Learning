Trains a resnet18 neural network on data stored in "Data".
Build a conda environment using spec-file.txt to run the project.

A resnet neural network takes the output from a node and passes it not only to the current layer + 1, but also current layer + 2.
This diminishes the effect of the vanishing gradient problem and allows neural networks to be trained significantly faster.
